//! Wrapper around the all IceCap crates used by the Runtime Manager.
//!
//! These crates only exist in the context of the IceCap build, so bundling them all together
//! allows the build system to replace them all at once with a dummy outside of the context of the
//! IceCap build system.
//!
//! This will be unecessary once we have per-isolate backend workspaces.
//!
//! The source of these crates can be found at:
//!
//! https://gitlab.com/arm-research/security/icecap/icecap/-/tree/main/src/rust/icecap
